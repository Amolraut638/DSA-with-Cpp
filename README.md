# DSA with C++

This repository contains my practice work and assignments while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.  
I have organized everything into different folders so itâ€™s easier to find and revise later.

##  Repository Structure

- **Assignments**  
  Basic C++ and DSA assignments I solved during practice.

- **C projects**  
  Small projects written in C language before starting with C++.

- **Classes and objects**  
  Programs related to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

- **DSA Imp Questions**  
  Important DSA problems that I solved for interview and practice.

- **DSA Using C++/Assignments**  
  Assignments directly related to Data Structures and Algorithms in C++.

- **Leedcode questions/merge sort**  
  My solutions for some LeetCode problems (starting with Merge Sort).

- **STL Assignments**  
  Assignments and problems solved using the **Standard Template Library (STL)** in C++.

- **STL**  
  Basic practice codes for learning STL (vectors, maps, sets, etc.).

##  Purpose
- To practice and improve my problem-solving skills  
- To keep all my assignments and codes in one place  
- To revise quickly before interviews and exams  
- To share with others who are learning C++ and DSA  

##  How to use
1. Clone this repository  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Amolraut638/DSA-with-Cpp.git
   ```
- Open any folder and run the .cpp files in a C++ compiler (like GCC or VS Code).
- Compile and check the outputs.

## Acknowledgement
- I would like to thank my teacher Saurabh Shukla Sir, online resources, and coding platforms for helping me in learning C++ and DSA step by step.
